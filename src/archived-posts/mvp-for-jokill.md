First things first, I have to define an MVP (minimum viable product) for Jokill platform. For the first version, I would like it to implement these features:
- A home page explaining what's Jokill about
- Registration page, asking for the email address, username, and password
- Login page
- Profile page to define your short/long term objectives in your career and make them public or private
- Search engine to find other users and their public objectives

The first milestone in the project is to provide this basic functionality using CI pipelines with cloud-ready products. I will also deploy the solution in a local Kubernetes installation.
