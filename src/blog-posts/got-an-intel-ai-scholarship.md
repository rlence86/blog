I'm very excited that I got one of the available seats for the [Intel Edge AI Scholarship Program](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/intel-edge-ai-scholarship)!

I applied to it to get a real taste about how these models work with real-life problems and I am starting classes tomorrow. 

I will be involved in this in the next 2.5 months to complete the Fundamentals Course so I will post here the things I find more interesting during the learning. According to the description, in this course I will:

> Learn how to use the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit to deploy computer vision applications at the network edge for the Internet of Things.

I hope to find all the needed time to do it properly.
