First things first, I have to define an MVP (minimum viable product) for Jokill platform. For a first version, I would like it to implement these features:
- Home page explaining what's Jokill about
- Registration page, asking for email address, username and password
- Login page
- Profile page to define your short/long term objectives in your career and make them public or private
- Search engine to find other users and their public objectives

The first milestone in the project is provide this basic functionality using CI pipelines with cloud ready products. I will also deploy the solution in a local Kubernetes installation.
