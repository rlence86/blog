One year ago, I acquired the domain jokill.com for a side project I had in mind. My idea was to create a social network to match developers or people trying to build an IT career with some mentors. Users could share their roadmaps for some years about what they wanted to learn and get feedback from other more experienced mates.

There was also another use case for this tool: allow tech companies to share their roadmap for aspirants to get all knowledge needed to apply successfully to some of their open positions.

For me, what looks more challenging is how to operate a platform like this by myself so I was postponing the development of it. Until now.

I have decided to build it anyway. At this point, I don't have any plan to start operating it, but I will build it step by step using most of the technologies I have learned in these last years. The project will be open source and all the code will be publicly available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/rlence86). I will use my blog and GitHub tools to explain and expose how this platform is evolving step by step.

I plan to use this project as a showcase for anyone interested in these technologies (initially Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend microservices, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Spring Cloud, Spring JPA, etc) or in the practices used (TDD development, testing pyramid, monitoring). Also, I plan to make it some kind of portfolio of what I have learned and also as a research lab to learn much more things on the go (MongoDB, React, Node, etc).

There is a [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/rlence86/projects/1) for this as a Kanban board where you can follow what's the current state and what's coming next. I will share links to the repositories when I create them on every step.
