      Hi there! I'm a software developer based in MÃ¡laga (Spain). Since 2012 I'm working mainly in 
      web development with different tech stacks. Initially I was working with PHP + MySQL 
      and JQuery. Later I was introduced in Symfony and other PHP Frameworks. In the last 
      years I'm mainly working in Java (Spring Boot) and Angular.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in many software development topics like testing, containerization, 
      continuous integration / deployment, good practices (clean code, aquitectures), 
      machine learning, games development or VR.
    </p>
    <p>
      This blog is intended to be a register for all my learnings and projects. I hope 
      you could find it interesting and illustrative.
