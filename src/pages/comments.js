    <p>
      From now on, comments will be enabled in every post. These comments will work with <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Disqus</a> so they 
      will be stored in their servers and you will need a Disqus account to comment in my blog.

      I would like to have your feedback about what I'm doing here so I encourage you to provide your respectful point of view. I accept all opinions but not 
      those that are not respectful to me or with other visitors, so those opinions won't be published.

      Thank you in advance for your participation.
